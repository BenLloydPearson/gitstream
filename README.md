# /:\ gitStream

**gitStream automates your reviews, so you can focus human effort on what matters most.** Not all Pull Requests are the same. Some reviews can be automated, like changes using a specific API (deprecated, sensitive), changes that are non-functional, like docs or tests, or even reformatting code. Automate these reviews to reduce context switches by assigning specific people to review, approve, or even merge simple changes that passed all checks, and more.

## Continuous Merge

**Continuous Merge (CM)** is the practice of automating the merge path by classifying pull requests based on change type, size, and complexity to allow work to flow more efficiently.
