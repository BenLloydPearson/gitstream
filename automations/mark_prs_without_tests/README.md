### Mark PRs without tests

PRs that don't have tests changes can be marked automatically.

When a PR is opened without any tests, this label is added:

![missing-tests-label](missing-labels-example.png)

Once the tests are added and committed, gitStream automatically removes the label:

![removing-missing-tests-label](removing-missing-labels-example.png)
