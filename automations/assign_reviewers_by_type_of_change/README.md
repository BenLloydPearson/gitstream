## Assign reviewers by type of change

Automatically assign code owners to review certain changes based on file types.

Use this when you want to assign a list of reviewers based to a PR automatically. When using `add-reviewers` the approval is optional, another option is to use `require-reviewers` instead, so the approval by this user is mandatory.
