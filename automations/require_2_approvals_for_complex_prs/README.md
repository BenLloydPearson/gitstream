## Require 2 approvals for complex PRs

Automatically require 2 reviewers for PRs that have more than 100 lines of code changed under the `src` directory.

This ability can be very useful if you want to have more approvals for certain PRs, but rather than increasing the required approvals for all PRs using GitHub repo settings, it allows to do that only for specific PRs.
