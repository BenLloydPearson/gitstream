# /:\ gitStream

**gitStream automates your reviews, so you can focus human effort on what matters most.** Not all Pull Requests are the same. Some reviews can be automated, like changes using a specific API (deprecated, sensitive), changes that are non-functional, like docs or tests, or even reformatting code. Automate these reviews to reduce context switches by assigning specific people to review, approve, or even merge simple changes that passed all checks, and more.

#### Quick Start

Take these three steps to see how gitStream works; later on you can learn about the .cm file, see some automation examples and learn how to create and edit your automation.

1. Get gitStream for free from [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/gitstream-by-linearb)
2. Add these 2 files [`.cm/gitstream.cm`](/downloads/gitstream.cm) and [`.github/workflows/gitstream.yml`](/downloads/gitstream.yml) to your repo
3. Open a new PR to see gitStream in action (You donâ€™t have to merge it)
