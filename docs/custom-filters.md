# Custom filters

gitStream enables you to build custom Javascript plugins to extend its functionality for more advanced data processing and pulling data from external APIs. gitStream plugins are based on the [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) module standard, a widely used pattern for structuring and importing JavaScript modules. This approach enables you to create and integrate custom filters and functionalities seamlessly within your gitStream automations.

## Folder structure

Custom plugins in gitStream are organized using a specific folder structure:

**Specific Repo Filters**: In the desired repository, place your filter plugins in the following location:
```.cm/plugins/filters/<filterName>/index.js```

**Asynchronous Filters**: Name asynchronous filters with an Async suffix, e.g.:
```.cm/plugins/filters/<filterNameAsync>/index.js```

**Org Level Filters**: Place these filters in your `cm` repository in the following location:
```plugins/filters/<filterName>/index.js``` 

!!! Tip

    If two filters have the same name, the one in the repository currently overrides the one at the organization level.

!!! Note
    
    gitStream actions are terminated by default after 15 minutes, with no current option for extending this limit.

!!! Note 

    Errors in custom plugins are output as logs. Users can implement their own error handling; otherwise, gitStream will log errors in its default format.

#### Filter usage in gitStream

Once you've created your custom plugin, it can be called using the same convention as default gitStream filter functions, for example:

```{{ "one banana" | bananify }}```

## Example: Creating a Custom Filter

Here's an example of a simple custom filter that replaces the word "banana" with a banana emoji (üçå).

**Create the Filter**: In your gitStream project, navigate to the `.cm/plugins/filters/bananify` directory and create the following `index.js` file:

```js
module.exports = (text) => {
  return text.replaceAll('banana', 'üçå');
}
```

**Using the Filter in Automations**: You can use this custom filter in your repository gitStream automations. Here's an example of how to use it in a CM automation script:

```yaml+jinja
# -*- mode: yaml -*-

manifest:
  version: 1.0

automations:
  banana_check:
    if:
      - {{ pr.description | includes(term='banana') }}
    run:
      - action: add-comment@v1
        args:
          comment: |
            BANANAS! {{ pr.description | bananify }}
```

In this example, the bananify filter is applied to the pull request description. gitStream will post a comment that changes all occurrences of the word "banana" with a banana emoji.
